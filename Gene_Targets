Evaluation of possible gene targets for overexpression and knockouts. The evaluation is done using Flux Scanning based Enforced Objective Flux (FSEOF) from the CAMEO package.  


# Flux through heterologous pathway is dependent on disrupting flux through the natural pathway to Ergosterol
# erg6 + erg5 deletion, either setting flux = 0 or by cobra.flux_analysis_single_gene_deletion
