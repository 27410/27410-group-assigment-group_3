    "## Dynamic Flux Based Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating a single number for the progesterone yield and flux - as we mostly do during this report - gives little information about what the final titres will be. \n",
    "To get a better idea of how the progesterone and biomass titres change over time, it can be insightful to mimick real conditions by simulating a simple batch fermentation. This is the purpose of Dynamic Flux Based Analysis (DFBA)\n",
    "\n",
    "We used cobra and dfba packages to make a DFBA and simulate a batch fermentation in defined intitial conditions. The code is run in the following steps:\n",
    " - Load libraries and model\n",
    " - Calculcate optimal fluxes for biomass and progesterone and adjust the lowerbound for progesterone.\n",
    " - Make DFBA model\n",
    " - Add Kinetic variables \n",
    " - Add Exchange Fluxes\n",
    " - Add right-hand-side expressions (rhs) for kinetic variables\n",
    " - Lower/upper bound expressions for exchange fluxes\n",
    " - Define initial conditions\n",
    " - Run simulation and plot concentrations and trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note, that this code requires another version of python than our other scripts are running. It might therefore be necessary to make a new environment with python version 3.7 and install the dfba package in order to run this script. In ubuntu, you can use the quoted code below. "

In constrast, the positive values for biomass and progesterone means that it is produced. \n",

    "Progesterone is obviously produced at low levels with a constant flux of 0.1562, since we had to define this as constant due to the issues of running the simulation when the model had two objects. Therefore, the progesterone levels do not decrease as a consequence of the decreasing glucose and biomass levels. This would most certainly not be the case in real life, but is the best solution we have for the current tools we are using. One could also decide to set the progeterone production as the objective and then the biomass production to a constant optimal level, and the model would then show that progesterone production decrased as a consequence of decreasing glucose.\n",

    "To make a better simulation in the future, it would be necessary to have two objectives for the simulation. It could then be interesting to test how the different concentrations of oxygen and glucose could affect growth and progesterone production. As we have found optimal levels for these substrates (see 04_phenotypic_phase_plane_analysis.ipynb), it is likely that a fed-batch simulation would give a higher progesterone titre, since this would allow keeping the glucose concentration more constant and closer to its optimal level during the simulation.\n"
