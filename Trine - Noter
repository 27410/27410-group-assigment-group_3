In fungus, ergosterol is naturally produced as it is an important component of the fungal cell membrane and plays an important role in it's stress-resistance response. Ergosterol is also a precursor molecule for steroid drugs, hence, it would be obvious to use yeast as a heterologous host for the expression of steroid compounds by the insertion of genes encoding the rest of the sterol pathway to form high-value compounds (e.g. androdiene,, progesterone, and testosterone.)

Yeast have many beneficial traits in regards to heterologous expression of industrial molecules. Especially, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a popular host organism as it is probably the most well-understood eukaryotic organism, is easily genetic manipulated, and it's cell structure resembles that of higher eukaryotic organisms, e.g. plants and animals. However, the downside to using yeast as expression host is that they tend to have low resistance to large production of hydrophobic compounds and it is difficult to have the heterologous compound secreted to the media.

"The annual global market for steroid-containing products exceeds $10 billion with about 300 steroid drugs approved (Fernandez-Cabezon et al. 2018)."  (læs reference - kan blive brugt til markedsdelen)

"Because of their deficiency in nature, most of these specialized steroids were produced by chemical synthesis (Brower 2008). " (læs reference)


The biosynthesis from ergosterol to steroid hormone requires several steps catalyzed by cytochrome P450s and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (Kristan and Rizner 2012; Xu and Li 2020). (læs referencer)

Obstacles for using yeast as production host for the production of heterologous steroid hormones:
	- Poor loading (??) and secretion of heterologous compounds e.g. enzymes and steroids
	- Low separatation of enzymes and substrates (hvad betyder dette?)
	- Oxidative stress caused by the production of heterolougs steroids that require several redox steps

"Moreover, steroids are an important pharmaceutical medication, with the global steroid market projected to reach $17 billion in 2025 [13]. " (læs reference til markedsdelen)

Ergosterol naturally produced by yeast is similar to sterol molecules of higher eukaryotic organisms making yeast a promising candidate for heterologous expression of sterols and their derivatives.[20] (læs reference)


"As described in our recent work, the natural compartmentalization of sterol synthesis and esterification in yeast blocked the access of downstream enzymes (e.g., CYB90B1, SMT2) to the sterol substrates, which leads to the failed synthesis of the target products. Although inactivation of the acyltransferases ARE1 and ARE2 enabled the synthesis of free sterol and downstream target metabolites, it also introduced growth deficiency and decreased overall sterol production, which is possibly due to the cytotoxicity of excessive free sterols [77]."




Plan for de novo synthesis of progesterone in yeast:
Ergosterol production needs to be disrupted to lead flux towards steroid production. 
Last step of natural yeast synthesis needed is production of ergosta-5,7,24(28)-trien-3b-ol 
	- Insert enzymes:
		○ DWF5/DHCR7
			□ Ergosta-5,7,24(28)-trien-3b-ol    ->    24,Methylenecholesterol
		○ DWF1 /ERG4
			□ 24,Methylenecholesterol           ->   Campesterol   
		○ CYP11A1
			□ Campesterol                       ->   Pregnenolone
		○ 3beta-HSD/3KSI
			□ Pregnenolone                      ->   Progesterone                                  
		


Potential strategies for optimization:
	- ERG genes rely on oxygen concentration; the regulator proteins UPC2 and ECM22 regulates this
			○ E.g. overexpression of these genes to lead flux through this pathway
				□ Based on Ma et al. (2018) Wang et al. (2018) 
	- Regulator INO2 -> overexpression of this leads flux towards cell membrane synthesis -> higher expression of e.g. squalene (Kim et al. 2019). 
	- Disruption of PAH1 leads to expansion of ER -> more room for heterologous steroid -> increase in accumulation of ergosterol in culture medium  (Arendt et al. 2017) 
	- To relieve oxidative stress -> feed yeast with media supplemented with lysine or methionine -> leads flux towards production of NADPH which binds e.g. ROS -> higher tolerance towards oxidative stress 
	- Downregulation of ERG4 and ERG5 to disrupt production of ergosterol
		○ Cannot knockout erg4 as it is important for plasma membrane integrity
		○ Erg5 is not as important and may be knocked-out
	- Steroids, such as campesterol and pregnanolone [75] -> intracellular accumulation of heterologous steroids is toxic for the host cell
		○ Optimize extracellular transport of progesterone (look into possibilities)
			□ Might be overcome by using Y. lipolytica as expression host instead
