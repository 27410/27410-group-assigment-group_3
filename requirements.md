# Expectations (everyone):

~~DONE~~

*in progress*

 - ~~Add heterologous pathway to GSM (if needed)~~ 
 - Calculate theoretical maximum yields for chosen product for suitable carbon sources (*Qvist*)
 - Plot phenotypic phase planes for relevant process conditions (anaerobic vs aerobic for example, what does make more sense?)
 
 
 ## Additional expectations for Category II projects:

 - Computationally enumerate all potential production pathways to your chosen product (even if it is a native product) and score them by different metrics (yield, number of steps added,)
 - Compute gene knockout strategies using algorithms like OptKnock, OptGene and OptCouple
 - Compute over-expression and down-regulation targets
 - Compute co-factor swap targets
 - Assess your predicted strain designs using simulations and pathway visualizations
 - Assess manually derived strain designs using model simulations
 - Simulate batch cultivations using dynamic FBA
 - Based on your computations, provide a top 10 list of most promising cell factory designs. The criteria for "most promising" are the number of modifications, yield, growth rate and others you might define


# Oral Presentation

Prior to handing in, the groups will present their work orally to the other students for a chance to get feedback on their reports (5 min presentation + 5 min feedback).  An opponent group will be assigned to each presentation (which will get the task to review the project repository prior to the presentation), but everyone will have the option to comment.

# Grading

Reports will be graded on the 7 step scale by the teacher and will be included in the final grade based on the following formula:

Final grade = 50% group project + 50% final programming assignment at the end of course
