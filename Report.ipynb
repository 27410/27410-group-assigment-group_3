    "Steroids are ring-structured lipophilic compounds serving various functions in cells. They are of huge pharmaceutical interest, as they are used to treat various diseases and manage both male and female fertility (Tong et al. 2009). Progesterone (**Figure 1**), a female sex hormone, is among the most valuable steroid drugs (Batth et al. 2020) . It is mainly used as a contraceptive, which has been on the market for decades (Howie 1985; Nath et al. 2010)\n",

    "The chemical synthesis of steroids was a highly competitive research field during the 20th century (Slater 2000). In 1940, Bachmann and Wilds produced the sex hormone equilenin as the first complex molecule to be chemically synthesized (Bachmann et al. 1940). In the following decades, many other steroids, including progesterone, were fully chemically synthesized with RB Woodward revolutionizing the field in 1952 (Woodward et al. 1952; Al Jasem 2014). He later won the Nobel prize for this work (Bartlett et al. 1965). \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the great efforts in the chemical synthesis of steroids, the structural complexity of steroids complicates their synthesis which often requires harsh conditions and contributes to heavy environmental pollution (Tong et al. 2009). Therefore, most steroid drugs are produced semi-synthetically, using a naturally abundant complex precursor as a starting point. Diosgenin, a steroidal sapogenin, is commonly used as a precursor and can be extracted from plants of the *Dioscorea* genus (Jesus et al. 2016; Al Jasem 2014; Dong et al. 2015). For example, progesterone can be produced from diosgenin via the so-called Marker synthesis (Al Jasem 2014). However, the protection and limited availability of these *Dioscorea* plants have caused increasing market prices of diosgenin. \n",
    "\n",
    "Collectively, the obstacles in the synthesis of steroids pushed researchers to look towards alternative production methods, namely through natural biosynthesis using microbial cell factories (Tong et al. 2009). Mild reaction conditions, lower chemical pollution, and higher conversion rates are among the advantages of using microbial cell factories in steroid production as compared to chemical synthesis (Tong et al. 2009). To our knowledge, no progesterone-producing cell factory has been published. Therefore, we decided to design one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the biosynthetic pathway of progesterone is crucial to design a cell factory since it aids in choosing a suitable type of cell host for the cell factory. The biosynthesis of all steroids starts in the production of the triterpenoid precursor, squalene, in the mevalonate pathway (**Figure 2**). Through several enzymatic steps, squalene can then be cyclized to establish the foundation of all steroids including progesterone (Buhaescu et al. 2007). With this knowledge, it seemed reasonable to choose a cell host already skilled at producing squalene as the starting point.\n",

    "\n",
    "When designing a cell factory, the first decisive decision to make is which cell to pick as the chassis. The cell host must be culturable. To integrate a heterologous pathway, the cell must be genetically engineerable as well. Additionally, it is a huge advantage if the cell host is well-known in the industry, has status as GRAS (generally regarded as safe), and naturally produces the compound of interest or a suitable precursor. Sometimes, some enzymes required in the heterologous pathway depend on certain features, such as eukaryotic organelles, which is the case for progesterone production, precluding prokaryotes. After considering various cell hosts – including the mammalian CHO-cells, microalgae, and non-conventional yeasts – our final choice ended at baker’s yeast, *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*S. cerevisiae* is the most studied eukaryote that lives up to all the above-mentioned requirements except that it does not produce progesterone naturally (Parapouli et al. 2020). It does, however, produce squalene, which is used to produce the steroid, ergosterol (Xu et al. 2020). Extensive research of *S. cerevisiae* recently enabled researchers to generate a strain producing a staggering 21 g squalene pr. L, placing *S. cerevisiae* at the forefront of squalene-producing cell factories (Paramasivan et al. 2022; Zhu et al. 2021). Overproduction of the squalene is a good starting point for the overproduction of steroids as well, as more precursors will be available. \n",
    "\n",
    "Several issues challenge the production of steroids with *S. cerevisiae*. One issue is that many steroids are non-exportable and might cause toxic effects when accumulating in the cell. Using non-conventional yeasts, like *Yarrowia lipolytica* or *Pichia pastoris*, might aid in solving these issues. For example, *Y. lipolytica* also efficiently produces steroid precursors and is known for its ability to accumulate lipids and lipophilic compounds, and therefore maybe also steroids (Xu et al. 2020; Worland et al. 2020; Adrio 2017). *P. pastoris* holds an efficient secretion system, which has been suggested to allow extracellular steroid synthesis to overcome the toxic effect of steroid accumulation (Xu et al. 2020; Ahmad et al. 2014). The downside of these non-conventional strains is that they are much less studied compared to *S. cerevisiae*. As designing cell factories computationally heavily rely on representative and detailed models, we still decided to use *S. cerevisiae* as our model organism. Nonetheless, we believe that the findings for *S. cerevisiae* in this report will be applicable for other yeast strains.\n",

A reason why we cannot simulate an effect is due to the fact that growth and progesterone production is already optimized as much as possible because they are set to be the objective. This reflects reality where it is of interest to get the highest possible production of progesterone and the most optimal growth. It does not make sense to set either of them to be the objective because this would result in only growth and no progesterone production or only progesterone production and no growth. \n",

    "We performed the analysis on our model (iMM904_progesterone) setting the enforced objective to be progesterone. The flux of 117 reactions changed as a result of an increasing flux towards progesterone. Reactions which are a part of the heterologous pathway were removed because they are not relevant targets: It is obvious that their increase in flux follows the same as the enforced increased progesterone flux. Also, reactions which flux was close to 0 were not of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure X shows the 20 reactions (including DM_progesterone_c reference) with the highest relative flux change when increasing the progesterone flux. These reactions are promising targets for up- or downregulation. The most up-regulated reactions are G3PD1ir, GLYCDy, G3PT, and DHAK with a flux increase with 4.58 mmol/(gDW*h). These reactions form a cycle where NAD(+) and NADPH are formed. By increasing the flux through this cycle, the concentration of NAD(+) and NADPH are increased in the cell. Since these co-factors are used to produce progesterone (**Figure 3**), it makes sense that when these co-factors are increased then the flux through progesterone is increased as well.\n",

    "The balance of co-factors within a cell is important to obtain a high theoretical yield of a given product (King, Zachary A., and Adam M. Feist, 2014). In our implemented pathway, the cell uses four NADPH and only one NAD(+) to produce progesterone. Due to this extensive use of NADPH, we investigated if we could improve the co-factor balance by producing more NADPH on the cost of NADH. \n",

For the initial model, the progesterone productivity decreases around a biomass productivity of 0.10.

In other words, the biomass productivity increases by 60% when maximum progesterone productivity is priotized.\n",

    "Our work indicates that it is possible to produce the heterologous steroid progesterone using *S. cerevisiae* as host and that the production can be optimized computationally, to find the best strategies for maximizing the yield obtained. Such a production would be more sustainable than the current production and, thus, contribute to several of the UN sustainable development goals (SDG); These goals describe the steps necessary to ensure a sustainable future for all.  Our work is related to SDGs 3 (by promoting health), 9 (by being innovative), and 12 (by ensuring responsible production), and if successful, will provide a better alternative for steroid production and contribute to a sustainable tomorrow."
