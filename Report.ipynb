Progesterone (**Figure 1**), a female sex hormone, is among the most valuable steroid drugs [2]. It is mainly used as a contraceptive, which has been on the market for decades [3,4]\n"

Nonetheless, both full and partial chemical syntheses of steroids were a highly competitive research field during the 20th century [7]. In 1940, Bachmann and Wilds produced the sex hormone equilenin as the first complex molecule to be chemically synthesized [6]. In the following decades, the chemical synthesis of other steroids was invented with the XX revolutionizing the field. However (write that chemical synthesis is carried out at harsh conditions not very efficient other downsides). Write that is why microbial production is more cool! And that is the bridge to next section.\n",
