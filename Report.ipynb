    "The chemical synthesis of steroids was a highly competitive research field during the middle of the 20th century [7]. In 1940, Bachmann and Wilds produced the sex hormone equilenin as the first complex molecule to be chemically synthesized [6]. In the following decades, many other steroids, including progesterone, were fully chemically synthesized with RB Woodward revolutionizing the field in 1952 [11,9]. He later won the Nobel prize for this work [12]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the great efforts in the chemical synthesis of steroids, the structural complexity of steroids complicates their synthesis which often requires harsh conditions and contributes to heavy environmental pollution [1]. Therefore, most steroid drugs are (CARO COMMENT: nowadays) produced semi-synthetically, using a naturally abundant complex precursor as a starting point. Diosgenin, a steroidal sapogenin, is commonly used as a precursor and can be extracted from plants of the *Dioscorea* genus [8,9,10]. For example, progesterone can be produced from diosgenin via the so-called Marker synthesis [9]. However, the protection and limited availability of these plants have caused increasing market prices of diosgenin. Collectively, the obstacles in the synthesis of steroids pushed researchers to look towards alternative production methods, namely through natural biosynthesis using microbial cell factories [1]! Mild reaction conditions, lower chemical pollution, and higher conversion rates are among the advantages of using microbial cell factories in steroid production as compared to chemical synthesis. To our knowledge (and surprise), no cell factory has been reported to produce progesterone. (CARO COMMENT: This will contribute to the important transistion to a biobased economy.)\n"

    "\n",
    "When designing a cell factory, the first crucial decision to make is which cell to pick as the chassis. The cell host must be culturable. To integrate a heterologous pathway, the cell must be genetically engineerable as well. Additionally, it is a huge advantage if the cell host is well-known in the industry, has status as GRAS (generally regarded as safe), and naturally produces the compound of CARO COMMET: interest) or a suitable precursor. Sometimes, (CARO COMMENT: delete 'some') enzymes required in the heterologous pathway depend on certain features, such as eukaryotic organelles, which is the case for progesterone production, precluding prokayrotes (**can be better**). After considering various cell hosts – including the mammalian CHO-cells, microalgae, and the yeast *Yarrowia lipolytica* – our final choice ended on baker’s yeast, *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*S. cerevisiae* is the most studied eukaryote and lives up to all the above-mentioned requirements except that it does not produce progesterone naturally [13]. It does, however, produce squalene; a triterpenoid precursor in steroid biosynthesis. During the mevalonate pathway, several enzymatic steps result in the cyclization of squalene, establishing the foundation of all steroids [5] (**Can be better written here**).\n",
    "\n",
    "S. cerevisiae is already considered a promising cell factory for squalene many publications have focused on engineering S. cerevisiae to overproduce squalene [14,15]. This is despite the fact that **MENTION THAT HYDROPHOBIC COMPOUNDS CAN BE TOXIC**. Therefore, non-conventional cell hosts, such as the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, have gained attention as well. Nonetheless, the extensive research of S. cerevisiae recently enabled researchers to generate a strain producing a staggering 21 g squalene pr. L, placing S. cerevisiae at the forefront of squalene-producing cell factories [14,15]. \n",

This model will serve as the foundation to identify reaction targets for knock-outs, over-expression, and knock-downs. Additionally, we perform a co-factor swapping analysis to test the effect on growth and progesterone production when swapping nadh and nadph in the identified reactions. To understand the effect on growth and progesterone production of our implemented alterations, we generate phenotypic phase plane plots, calculate maximum theoretical yields and fluxes, can perform a dynamic flux balance analysis of a batch fermentation.Lastly, we will assess several **MENTION EXACT NUMBER** of the strains we have designed to conclude which of them that are most likely to be the best progesterone-producing cell factory. \n"
