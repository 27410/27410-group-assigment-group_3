    "Steroids are ring-structured lipophilic compounds serving various functions in cells. They are of huge pharmaceutical interest, as they are used to treat various diseases and manage both male and female fertility [1]. Progesterone (**Figure 1**), a female sex hormone, is among the most valuable steroid drugs [2]. It is mainly used as a contraceptive, which has been on the market for decades [3,4].\n",

    "The market size for progesterone alone is currently estimated to be USD $800 million but is expected to reach a staggering USD $1569 million by 2027; in other words, the market size will nearly double within the next five years, due to the increasing progesterone demand (Market Data Forecast, 2022).

    "The chemical synthesis of steroids was a highly competitive research field during the middle of the 20th century [7]. In 1940, Bachmann and Wilds produced the sex hormone equilenin as the first complex molecule to be chemically synthesized [6]. In the following decades, many other steroids, including progesterone, were fully chemically synthesized with RB Woodward revolutionizing the field in 1952 [11,9]. He later won the Nobel prize for this work [12]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the great efforts in the chemical synthesis of steroids, the structural complexity of steroids complicates their synthesis which often requires harsh conditions and contributes to heavy environmental pollution [1]. Therefore, most steroid drugs are produced semi-synthetically, using a naturally abundant complex precursor as a starting point. Diosgenin, a steroidal sapogenin, is commonly used as a precursor and can be extracted from plants of the *Dioscorea* genus [8,9,10]. For example, progesterone can be produced from diosgenin via the so-called Marker synthesis [9]. However, the protection and limited availability of these plants have caused increasing market prices of diosgenin. Collectively, the obstacles in the synthesis of steroids pushed researchers to look towards alternative production methods, namely through natural biosynthesis using microbial cell factories [1]! Mild reaction conditions, lower chemical pollution, and higher conversion rates are among the advantages of using microbial cell factories in steroid production as compared to chemical synthesis. To our knowledge (and surprise), no cell factory has been reported to produce progesterone.\n"
