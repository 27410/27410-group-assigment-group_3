Check squalene yield/flux. 
Kan vi prøve at efterligne det litteraturen har gjort for at få rekorden for squalene production?

WOOPS! Check artificial something in the circle you are making in the heterologous pathway.
It is called FUTILE CYCLING

What is the growth rate when you calculate yield! Good to mention. 

Can we maybe add some boundaries to our phenotypic phase plane plot? To make it more realistic

A group made an interactive pathway map with Escher Builder. That is really cool!

FSEOF is very used.
But most people use another plot than we do. 

co-factor swapping seems to be a pretty unique thing that we do.

Growth media optimization? (men ikke et requirement)

Kan vi påvise at generne vi knockouter resulterer i basically ingen growth?

MOMA?

Network?
